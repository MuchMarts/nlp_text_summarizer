Gender disparities in employment within the ICT field in Latvia remain a persistent issue despite ongoing efforts to promote equality and inclusivity. From early education to professional careers, women are consistently underrepresented in technology-related roles. In basic and secondary education, girls tend to participate less in ICT subjects due to societal stereotypes, limited exposure, and a lack of female role models. This trend continues into higher education, where women are less likely to enroll in ICT degree programs such as computer science or software engineering, often opting instead for fields like business or social sciences. In the workforce, men dominate technical roles such as software development, network administration, and cybersecurity, while women are more commonly found in positions like project management, user support, and UI/UX design. Although there is a slight increase in female participation among younger professionals—thanks in part to coding bootcamps, online learning platforms, and targeted outreach—mid-career women often face challenges such as limited career progression, lack of mentorship, and difficulty balancing work and family life. These barriers contribute to higher attrition rates among women in tech as they advance in age and experience. Despite these challenges, there are promising signs of change. Government initiatives, EU-funded programs, and industry-led diversity efforts are creating more opportunities for girls and women to engage in ICT. Programs offering mentorship, scholarships, and inclusive workplace policies are gradually shifting the landscape. However, to achieve lasting gender balance in Latvia’s ICT sector, systemic changes in education, corporate culture, and societal attitudes are still urgently needed.
