Gender disparities in employment within the ICT field in Latvia remain a persistent issue despite ongoing efforts to promote equality and inclusivity.

From early education to professional careers, women are consistently underrepresented in technology-related roles.

In the workforce, men dominate technical roles such as software development, network administration, and cybersecurity, while women are more commonly found in positions like project management, user support, and UI/UX design.

Mid-career women often face challenges such as limited career progression, lack of mentorship, and difficulty balancing work and family life.

Government initiatives, EU-funded programs, and industry-led diversity efforts are creating more opportunities for girls and women to engage in ICT.

However, to achieve lasting gender balance in Latviaâ€™s ICT sector, systemic changes in education, corporate culture, and societal attitudes are still urgently needed.
