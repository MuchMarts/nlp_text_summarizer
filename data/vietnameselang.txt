Vietnamese has a special unit called “tiếng” that corresponds at the same time to a syllable with respect to phonology, a morpheme with respect to morpho-syntax, and a word with respect to sentence constituent creation. For convenience, we call these “tiếng” syllables. The Vietnamese vocabulary contains simple words, which are monosyllabic; reduplicative words composed by phonetic reduplication; compound words composed by semantic coordination and by semantic subodination; complex words phonetically transcribed from foreign languages.
The Vietnamese lexicon edited recently by the Vietnam Lexicography Center (Vietlex1) contains 40, 181 words and idioms, which are widely used in contemporary spoken language, newspapers
and literature. These words are made up of 7, 729 syllables. Table 1 shows some interesting statistics of the word length measured in syllables. 6, 303 syllables (about 81.55% of syllables) are words by themselves. Two-syllable words are the most frequent, consisting of nearly 71% of the vocabulary.
