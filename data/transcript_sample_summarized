I'm Justin. I'm your third instructor for 6.006. This is my first time with this course.

We're going to pick up where we left off in our last lecture and continue on with a similar theme that we're going to see throughout our algorithms class here in 6.006.

There's an object called an interface, which is just a program specification. It's just telling us that there's a collection of operations that we want to implement.

What happens behind the scenes is something called a data structure, which is a way to actually, in some sense, implement an interface.

Essentially, we have two different decisions to make when we choose an algorithm: one is making sure that the interface is correct for the problem, and the other is choosing an appropriate data structure.

Today, in our lecture, we're concerned with one particular interface, which is called a set.
