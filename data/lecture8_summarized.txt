ATM (Acceptance Problem for Turing Machines):
ATM = { ⟨M, w⟩ | M is a Turing Machine and M accepts w } is undecidable.

Diagonalization Method:
Used to prove that the set of real numbers (ℝ) is uncountable.
Also used to prove that ATM is not decidable by constructing a machine D that leads to a contradiction.

ℕ, ℤ, ℚ⁺ are countable; ℝ is uncountable.
Σ* (all strings) is countable; the set of all languages is uncountable.

Therefore, some languages are not decidable since there are more languages than Turing Machines.

ATM is Turing-recognizable but its complement is not.
If both a language and its complement are Turing-recognizable, the language is decidable.

HALT_TM = { ⟨M, w⟩ | M halts on input w } is also undecidable (by reduction from ATM).

Turing-recognizable languages:
- Closed under union, intersection, concatenation, star.
- Not closed under complement.
