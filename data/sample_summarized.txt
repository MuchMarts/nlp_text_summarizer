Bananas are elongated edible fruits, botanically classified as berries, produced by flowering plants in the Musa genus. Originating in tropical Indomalaya and Australia with domestication in New Guinea, these seedless fruits grow in upward clusters and derive from wild species like Musa acuminata and Musa balbisiana. Cultivated across 135 countries—primarily in India and China—they serve as both raw snacks (dessert bananas) and cooked ingredients (plantains), though the distinction between these categories varies regionally, especially in Southeast Asia. The term "banana" also encompasses related species like scarlet or pink bananas. Significant threats include Panama disease and black sigatoka fungus, which particularly endanger the Cavendish variety dominant in global markets. Due to the challenges of breeding seedless commercial bananas, international gene banks preserve germplasm to safeguard future cultivation efforts.
