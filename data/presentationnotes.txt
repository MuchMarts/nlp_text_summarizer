Why the concern

Targets and Indicators

10 targets and 11 indicators.
Measure progress towards achieving inclusive and equitable quality of education for all 

For instance, exploring the indicators in Target 4.1 will allow us to understand how proficient children are in reading and mathematics at various stages of their education. This insight is crucial to tailor educational approaches for better outcomes.
Target
4.1 By 2030, ensure that all girls and boys complete free, equitable and quality primary and secondary education leading to relevant and effective learning outcomes
4.1.1 Proportion of children and young people (a) in grades 2/3; (b) at the end of primary; and (c) at the end of lower secondary achieving at least a minimum proficiency level in (i) reading and (ii) mathematics, by sex
4.1.2 Completion rate (primary education, lower secondary education, upper secondary education)



Economic Significance
Better equipped with skills and knowledge necessary in various fields → drives productivity, enhance competition in national and global market. 
Can adapt new technologies to facilitate optimized outputs. 
Diverse range in workforce, lessen the risk of not having enough resources for certain industries. 


Investment Areas for SDG4
Infrastructure: build and upgrade educational facilities - classrooms, libraries, laboratories, and other necessary infrastructure.
Pedagogical Training: enhance teaching quality and effectiveness.

“Age Of Access - The New Culture of Hypercapitalism”
Jeremy Rifkin -  American economic and social theorist.
Published in 2000
Discusses the transition from ownership-based economies to access-based models. 
⇒ Sharing economy and the As-a-Service model, emphasizing short-term asset use in a network-controlled system.


Rifkin’s book and UN SDG 4
While the book doesn’t seem to directly connect, the topic of the book more or less pertains to a few aspects that can be applied to objectives of SDG 4. 
Lifelong learning: evolving nature of access to knowledge, goods, and services.
Education Innovation: Rifkin discusses how the shift to access-based models impacts various sectors. In the context of education, access to educational resources and innovative learning methods is essential for achieving SDG 4. 
Inclusivity and Equity: discussion on access and sharing can be viewed in terms of creating a more inclusive and equitable society by ensuring broader access to resources and services, aligning with the spirit of SDG 4.


1. Lifelong Learning Opportunities: Rifkin's book touches on the evolving nature of access to knowledge, goods, and services. Lifelong learning is a key aspect of SDG 4, and the access to various resources discussed by Rifkin can be seen as part of a broader landscape of lifelong learning opportunities.

2. Education Innovation: Rifkin discusses how the shift to access-based models impacts various sectors. In the context of education, access to educational resources and innovative learning methods is essential for achieving SDG 4. The book's exploration of access in different sectors may shed light on innovative models that can be applied to education.

3. Inclusivity and Equity: SDG 4 emphasizes inclusivity and equity in education. Rifkin's discussion on access and sharing can be viewed in terms of creating a more inclusive and equitable society by ensuring broader access to resources and services, aligning with the spirit of SDG 4.

In summary, while "The Age of Access" primarily focuses on a broader societal shift toward access-based models, the themes of access, innovation, inclusivity, and lifelong learning can indirectly relate to and support the objectives of UN SDG 4.
